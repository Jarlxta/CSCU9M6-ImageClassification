    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you are required to apply the knowledge acquired in the module to solve a classification problem from images collected in the context of two different cities (A and B).\n",
    " - If the work is being carried out in pairs, **cities A and B must be the hometowns of each student**. In the case of individual work, city A must be your hometown and city B must be Stirling (or Edinburgh, if needed).\n",
    " - The standard recommendation is that the project focuses on classifying cars or trees image scenes, which are easier to identify and annotate. Other objects or phenomena can be adopted, but are subject to prior approval by the module instructor (Jefersson A. dos Santos). **You are not allowed to assemble datasets containing people. Other sensitive patterns, such as license plates, must be properly hidden.**\n",
    " - Don't panic! We are aware that acquiring images _in situ_ is an impediment for most students. The dataset can be assembled with images collected remotely or from public repositories. Just be careful with rights and permissions for using images found on the internet. Anyway, these factors must be taken into account for the problem definition.\n",
    " - While we encourage you to do interesting and engaging work, it shouldn't be too complex or time-consuming. Try to appropriately scale the time required for this step. Ask the instructors for advice, if necessary. **GA students:** you are encouraged to link the project with your work activities, but keep in mind you still need to construct two datasets (A and B). \n",

    "\n",
    "  - *M1* - Pictures taken by yourself on site (street view from cities A and B), with attention to anonymization issues (if it is the case). It is not allowed to assemble datasets containing people. Other sensitive patterns, such as license plates, must be properly hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *M2* - Aerial satellite/drone images obtained from GIS and remote sensing platforms or public repositories. Be careful with unusual file formats that may be challenging to manipulate using basic image processing libraries. We recommend keeping or converting the images to jpg or png.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *M3* - Pictures taken from other public available datasets. Remember you are not allowed to use datasets containing people or other sensitive patterns/objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *M4* - Images crawled from the internet as a whole (social networks, webpages, etc), with special attention to use and copyrights.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - *M5* - Textual and metadata you may need in your project, with special attention to use and copyrights (as always!).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** If you collect the images on your own or from aerial imagery repositories, it will be necessary to keep the geographic coordinates. If you collect from specific websites, please retain the source links. This information should be placed in a .csv file and made available along with the final dataset.\n",

Make a 2-page report using the [IEEE template](https://www.overleaf.com/read/rdqwshtvyjdn) with a maximum of 1000 words. Latex is recommended, but you can deliver the report in MS Word if you prefer. Your report should contain five sections: introduction, description of the proposed solution with justifications, results (here you can include the same graphs and pictures generated in this jupyter notebook), discussion of the results, and conclusion. Properly cite references to articles, tutorials, and sources used. A pdf version of your report should be made available in the project's github repository under the name \"[project name] + _final_report.pdf\".\n",
